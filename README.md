# MicroAuth

## Description:
Logging in and authentication is usually a pretty important step in the web applications I build, but it usually takes a long time to set up and the steps are very repetitive (almost copy and paste). To cut down the monotony in building a scalable web application, the barebones of an authenitcation microservice is built here. This service does not immediately run out of the box, you need to update secrets and and links but this can all be done in one file. This is built assuming it would be a part of a kubernetes cluster but that could easily be updated as well.
